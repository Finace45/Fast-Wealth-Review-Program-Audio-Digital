# Fast-Wealth-Review-Program-Audio-Digital
Fast Wealth is a 2-minute audio that rewires your brain by silencing the Crave Wave—an energy block in your thalamus—so you can attract wealth   effortlessly.

## Introduction: The Invisible Force Blocking Your Abundance

What if I told you that the very desire you have for financial freedom might be the exact thing pushing it away?
Yes—according to a shocking new discovery, your cravings, your visions, your goals may all be tangled in an invisible wave of energy… one that’s quietly sabotaging your success.

This is not another motivational seminar or Law of Attraction rehash. This is about a scientific breakthrough—an overlooked mechanism in your brain that may be distorting your energetic signals and blocking the flow of prosperity.

It's called the Crave Wave—and this revelation could change everything you thought you knew about manifesting wealth.

## What Is “Fast Wealth”?

“Fast Wealth” is an audio-based brain-realignment tool developed around the remarkable discovery of the Crave Wave by neuroscientist Harold Alexander. This isn’t about hustle. It’s not about affirmations or vision boards.

It’s about using targeted sound frequencies—in just two minutes, four times a week—to help quiet the Crave Wave in your brain’s thalamus and potentially realign your energy with the frequency of abundance.

That’s right: you may not need to do more… you may simply need to stop doing what’s unknowingly been repelling success.

## About the Creator: Frank & the Legacy of Harold Alexander

Frank, a seasoned personal development coach with 12 years of experience, isn’t your average guru. He was chosen—personally—by Harold Alexander, the neuroscientist who uncovered the Crave Wave after a near-death experience caused by a brain scanning prototype gone haywire.

Alexander’s research into the thalamus, a region of the brain once thought too primitive to affect abundance, opened the door to a secret world of energetic interference. And when he needed someone to bring his findings to the masses, he chose Frank.

Why? Because Frank understands transformation—and more importantly, he lives it.

## How Does It Work?

At its core, the Fast Wealth program is deceptively simple:

1.  Grab headphones
2.  Sit in a quiet space
3.  Listen for two minutes
4.  Repeat four times a week

That’s it.

The proprietary sound frequencies are designed to neutralize the Crave Wave, like noise-cancelling headphones for your brain. Once silenced, your energy may finally harmonize with the natural flow of wealth and abundance.

No affirmations. No journaling. No rituals.

Just science… and sound.

## What’s Included in “Fast Wealth”?

The Fast Wealth package includes:

-  The Fast Wealth Audio Track: The centerpiece—specially calibrated frequencies to potentially quiet your Crave Wave and restore energetic clarity.
